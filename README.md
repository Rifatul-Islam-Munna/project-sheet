## 🤸 Quick Start

Follow these steps to set up the project locally on your machine.

**Prerequisites**

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Git
- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)

**Cloning the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/salles-note.git
cd salles-note
```

**Installation**

Install the project dependencies for both frontend and backend:

```bash
# Install frontend dependencies
cd project-sheet
npm install

# Install backend dependencies
cd project-sheet-backend
npm install
```

**Set Up Environment Variables**

Create a `.env` file in both the `frontend` and `backend` directories with the following content:

**Frontend (.env)**

```env
BASE_URL = 
```

**Backend (.env)**

```env
MONGODBURL =
ACCESS_TOKEN =
REFRESH_TOKEN =
JWT_SECRET =
Api_secrate =
